    CamtrawlAcquisition.py is the image acquisition application for the

    collect images and video from Flir machine vision cameras compatible
    with the Flir Spinnaker SDK. Experimental support for V4L2 cameras
    is in the works.

    control interface (aka the Camtrawl Controller) to log its sensor
    streams and trigger the cameras and strobes. If the controller is not
    available, the application will trigger cameras using software triggering.
