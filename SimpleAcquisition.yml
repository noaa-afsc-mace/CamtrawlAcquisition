cameras:

#  Starting with acquisition version 4.3, multiple camera drivers are supported. The default
#  driver is SpinCamera. If you want to use a different driver, you specify it using the
#  'driver' keyword. Currently there are two drivers supported:
#
#    SpinCamera - Uses the Flir Spinnaker SDK and PySpin Python bindings to control Flir
#                       machine vision cameras. These must be installed to use this driver.
#    CV2VideoCamera - Uses the OpenCV VideoCapture class. This is a fairly generic interface
#                              that supports a wide array of devices thru a crazy number of backends.
#                              The specific backends available to you depend on how your OpenCV
#                              was compiled and not all of the configuration options are supported
#                              by all backend + camera combinations. Also, the valid inputs to
#                              the supported options will be different for different backend + camera
#                              combinations.
#
#  Since these drivers have different interfaces and offer different levels of control, not
#  all configuration options are going to be applicable to all camera + driver combinations.

#  #  This is an example of using the CV2VideoCamera driver to capture images.

#        gain: 1
#
#      #  the CV2VideoCamera driver exposure value is configured using the 'exposure' keyword
#      #  (which is different from the SpinCamera 'exposure_us' keyword.). The valid range and units
#      #  are specific to the back end CV2VideoCapture uses and your camera.
