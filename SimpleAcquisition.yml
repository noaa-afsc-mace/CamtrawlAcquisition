      #  Starting with acquisition version 4.3, multiple camera drivers are supported. The default
      #  driver is SpinCamera. If you want to use a different driver, you specify it using the
      #  'driver' keyword. Currently there are two drivers supported:
      #
      #    SpinCamera - Uses the Flir Spinnaker SDK and PySpin Python bindings to control Flir
      #                       machine vision cameras. These must be installed to use this driver.
      #   CV2VideoCapture - Uses the OpenCV VideoCapture class. This is a fairly generic interface
      #                             that supports a wide array of devices. As such, not all
      #
      #  Since these drivers have different interfaces and offer different levels of control, not
      #  all configuration options are going to be applicable to all camera + driver combinations.
        driver:  CV2VideoCapture

      #  The CV2VideoCapture driver requries either an index number which defines the camera
      #  to use. It may also accept a path in Linux (/dev/video0) but this is untested.
        cv2_cam_path: 1

      #  The effect and range of acceptable values for the camera parameters listed below
      #  will depend on the backend OpenCV is using and your specific camera.
        cv2_cam_width: 1280
        cv2_cam_height: 720


      #  gain may or may not be supported depending on the back end the CV2VideoCapture is
      #  using and your specific camera. If your camera doesn't support gain it will be ignored.
        gain: 1

      #  the CV2VideoCapture driver exposure value is configured using the 'exposure' keyword
      #  (which is different from the SpinCamera 'exposure_us' keyword.). The valid range and units
      #  are specific to the back end the CV2VideoCapture driver uses and your camera.
      #  Valid exposure values for the Microsoft LifeCam HD-3000 are -11 to 1
