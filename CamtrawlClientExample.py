        the imageReceived slot is called when the client receives an image from the server.

        It is important to remember that this slot will be called once for each camera
        that has a pending image request on the server. This means that if you request
        a simultaneous pair of images, you must track the received state of each camera
        so you know when you have both images to process.

            camera          - a string containing the camera name the image belongs to.
            label           - a string containing the camera label
            imageData       - a dict in the following form containing the image data and
                              metadata with the following keys:

                                imageData['data'] - image data as OpenCV numpy array
                                imageData['ok'] - True if image was received, False if there was a problem
                                imageData['exposure'] - camera exposure
                                imageData['gain'] - camera gain
                                imageData['height'] - image height
                                imageData['width'] - image width
                                imageData['timestamp'] - trigger timestamp
                                imageData['filename'] - image filename (if any)
                                imageData['image_number'] - global image number

                            imageData['data'] is a numpy array (height, width, depth)
                            and will typically be of dtype 'uint8' (theoretical support
                            for 'uint16' data exists but is not tested.) The depth will
                            be 1 for mono images and 3 for color images. The pixel order
                            is BGR and suitable for use with OpenCV but may need to be
                            converted before using with other image processing libraries.
